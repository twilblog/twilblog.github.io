# Background

In Chrome, when you're using a self signed SSL certificate
you'll sometimes see a warning message that you have to click through before
being allowed on to your page.

Newer versions of Chrome take this further, where if your self signed certificate
is super out of date, you don't even get the option to click through and ignore
the message.

# The Workaround

First of all, please note that you should only ever use this on servers you
control and are absolutely sure are not compromised. These warnings are there
for a reason.

Having said that, if you're reading this you're probably a web developer and know
what you're doing.

The simple workaround here is just to type `badidea` anywhere into the page. The
page will load as normal, and it will continue to do so as long as your session
continues.
